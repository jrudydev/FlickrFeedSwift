# FlickrFeedSwift
The goal of this project is to parallel an Objective-C iOS app using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. The apps pull the latest public feed from Flickr to be displayed in a UICollectionView. 

As a secondary goal, the networking will be handled in a variety of ways. From implementing NSURLSession, to a simple one view app, to leveraging third-party libraries via dependency managers such as CocoaPods and Carthage.
